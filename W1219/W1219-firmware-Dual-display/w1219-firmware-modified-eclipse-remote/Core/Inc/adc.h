   - Modified by RTEK1000
   - Mar/27/2023
   - Code adaptation for Arduino IDE sketch.ino
   - Some bug fixes
   - Some functions added
   - Note: Track the size of the code when uploading,
     The maximum I got was 93%
     --> (Sketch uses 7589 bytes (92%))
     --> (Bytes written: 8136)
     --> (Maximum is 8192 bytes)
