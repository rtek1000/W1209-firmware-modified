- Note: This repository is no longer a fork of the [original](https://github.com/mister-grumbler/w1209-firmware).
- - To allow new forks and issue openings in case a bug is found

- Note: [original](https://github.com/mister-grumbler/w1209-firmware) code adapted for Eclipse IDE project [here](https://github.com/rtek1000/W1209-firmware-modified/tree/master/w1209-firmware-modified/Eclipse%20project).

----------------

-----> **Do not use the board** without checking the relay **LED problem**. See below at "W1209 hardware (variation)"

----------------

- Apparently there is a bug in the compiler SDCC (v. 4.0.0), in case the display malfunctions when modifying the code:
- - Add a 'long' variable in the first file (name in alphabetical order) *.c

a_file.c:

```
#include "a_file.h"
long foo;
```

### Firmware for using the W1209 as a programmable timer, [here](https://github.com/rtek1000/W1209-firmware-modified/tree/master/W1209-firmware-Timer).

- There are 6 modes of operation (Looped or non-looped).
- Maximum time about 1000 minutes (about 16 hours and 40 minutes).
- Two-step timing (Times separated in minutes, seconds and milliseconds).
- Display automatically shows the most significant digits.
- Sensor input operating as a button.
- Remote Control (in progress).

----------------

### Firmware for using the W1209 as a programmable thermostat

#### Code adaptation for Eclipse IDE:
- Updates and new features have been added (Uses less program memory than the Arduino IDE).
- - Navigation between files and references is easier than in the Arduino IDE.
- - (apparently all functions working)

- Makefile compilation mode, similar to the [original](https://github.com/mister-grumbler/w1209-firmware) way.
- - (No more editing the Makefile file manually to modify source filenames).

- Remote version (serial port emulated by timers) [here](https://github.com/rtek1000/W1209-firmware-modified/tree/master/W1209-firmware-Remote).
- Windows app to manage settings:

           Waiting delay time programmed in Parameter P5
   - - Decimal point (DOT) right side on:
           Relay activated (contacts close)           
   - - Factory reset:
   - - - Set Parameter P7 in OFF
   - - - Turn power supply Off
   - - - Press and hold Up "+" and Down "-" keys
   - - - Turn power supply On
   - - - Wait for "rSt" to appear on the display
   - - - Release all keys
   - - - Wait for the current temperature to appear
   - Troubleshoot:
   - - Microcontroller resetting:
           Try using a pull up resistor on the reset line
   - - Microcontroller no longer responds:
           High voltage return may have occurred through the relay LED
   - - The temperature does not correspond to the real:
           Try adjusting the offset Parameter P5
           Try to replace the sensor
           Test using a resistor of NTC equivalent value for 25Â°C (10k)
           Try modifying the lookup table corresponding to the sensor
   - - Display flickering:
           Disconnect STlink programmer from SWIM port (next to display)
           
   - Note for Arduino IDE and Sduino core:
     Track the size of the code when uploading,
     The maximum I got was 93%
   - - (Sketch uses 7589 bytes (92%))
   - - (Bytes written: 8136)
   - - (Maximum is 8192 bytes)
   - Sduino core:
   - - Select STM8S Board / STM8S103F3 Breadout Board
   - - Programmer ST-link/V2
   - - Connect STlink: GND/SWIM/RST 

   - ST-Link V2 Programming Example on Linux (check Bin folder):
   - - stm8flash -c stlinkv2 -p stm8s003?3 -w W1209-firmware-Arduino-table_R2_5k1_NTC_10k_B3950.hex 
   - - - Determine FLASH area
   - - - STLink: v2, JTAG: v40, SWIM: v7, VID: 8304, PID: 4837
   - - - Due to its file extension (or lack thereof), "W1209-firmware-Arduino-table_R2_5k1_NTC_10k_B3950.hex" is considered as INTEL HEX format!
   - - - 8136 bytes at 0x8000... OK
   - - - Bytes written: 8136

## W1209 hardware (variation):
There is an error in the electronic circuit that can kill the microcontroller, make the modification as soon as possible. Avoid using the board without modifying it. See [here](https://github.com/mister-grumbler/w1209-firmware/issues/22).
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1465701/163829267-9fa689e8-70c2-4991-9749-82f886b1b8a6.jpg)

- Other details can be seen in this [post](https://github.com/TG9541/stm8ef/wiki/W1209-Identifying-'compliant'-boards).

- R2 is not the same for all boards:
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtek1000/w1209-firmware/master/Doc/w1209.png)

- The generic schematic diagram shows the value of 20K ohms for R2:
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtek1000/NTC_Lookup_Table_Generator/main/Img/image.jpg)

- R2 resistor: Some boards have a resistor value of 20k, others may have different values such as 5.1k, check the table in the adc.c file, if your board has a different value for R2 or for the sensor, it may be necessary to change the table rawADC[ ]:
